"""Compiled functions using Numba for performance optimization.

This module contains low-level computation functions optimized with Numba JIT
(Just-In-Time) compilation. These functions are typically wrapped by standard
Python functions in the `seapopym.function` module to handle xarray objects
and parallel execution.
